TestObject provides real devices in the cloud. We <b> strongly recommend to rely mainly on real devices for testing</b> as your customers use your app on real hardware too. Emulators can't guarantee your app will behave the same on real devices as it does on virtual devices.

<h3 id="device-list">Device List</h3>
Currently TestObject hosts more than 100+ different models of Android real devices. We constantly add more devices to our pool. To see if the devices you want to test on are available you can <b>see and download the complete device list including device specifications here:</b>

TestObject hosts 100+ real devices for manual and automated testing. You can fully remote-control the devices directly from your browser. The devices are located at TestObjects' data center in Germany and connected to servers. TestObject uses VNC (Virtual Networking Computer) to transmit mouse and keyboard events on a device. The VNC client on the device relaying back the graphical screen and you can control it remotely almost like holding the device in your hands.
