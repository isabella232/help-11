TestObject provides real smartphones and tablets in the cloud. You can upload and test your mobile applications on the devices directly from your browser. We <b> strongly recommend relying mainly on real devices for testing</b>, as your customers use your app on real hardware, too. Emulators can't guarantee your app will behave the same on real devices as it does on virtual devices.

Currently, TestObject hosts more than 100 different models of real Android devices. We constantly add more devices to our pool. To see if the devices you want to test on are available, please <b>see and download the complete device list, including device specifications, here:</b>

TestObject hosts 100+ real devices for manual and automated testing. You can fully remote control the devices directly from your browser. The devices are located at TestObjects' data center in Germany and connected to servers. TestObject uses a virtual networking computer (VNC) to transmit mouse and keyboard events on a device. The VNC client on the device relays back the graphical screen, and you can control it remotely. It is almost like holding the device in your hands.
