<h3 id="profile">Profile</h3>
Here you can change your personal information given at your sign up, like the first name, the last name or the email address you use. But what you cannot change is your username (which can be used to login), because it is unique and must be the same without changing to ensure allocating your data with your account.

<h3 id="password">Password</h3>
To change your password enter your new password into the text field and save. Done!<br>
If you made a typo or forgot what you chose as a password, you can always <a href="https://app.testobject.com/#/forgot" target="_blank">set back your password</a> when you login to the TestObject cloud.

- Enter your email address or user name
- You will receive a link via email
- Follow this link and enter a new password.

<h3 id="team-accounts">Inviting Team Members</h3>
If you have a Team plan, then you are able to add or remove teammates to your account. This means, you will be able to test your apps together with other team members. To do that:

- Open the Team tab.
- Invite your teammates by adding their email address.
- Wait for them to accept your invitation.
- <b>Ready!</b> Now they are able to see your apps and test results

<h3 id="plans">Testing Plans</h3>

After the signup you will start with a <b>free plan</b> by default. You will be able to upload your app and try out most of the features on the platform. This is not a trial, so you will be able to stay on the free plan for as long as you like. The free plan allows you to access a limited selection of our free real devices.
<img class="center shadow" src="/img/settings/free_devices.png"><br>

The <a href="#pre_plans">Premium Plans</a> allow you testing on hundreds of real devices and enjoying additional support services, like our <a href="https://app.testobject.com/#/chat" target="_blank">Live Chat</a> tool which enables you to contact directly with our professional support team while testing.<br>

TestObject offers two distinct types of plans for Manual and Automated testing. <a href="#manual_plan">Manual</a> and <a href="#automated_plan">Automated plans</a> need to be purchased separately. This allows you to choose the best individual solution for your app testing.
All standard plans underly a <b>fair use</b> policy. <br/> To ensure that no single user blocks devices permanently for other TestObject users, we reserve the right to limit the daily usage time, depending on the purchased plan. Your testing won't be terminated automatically if you exceeded your time limit during an intense testing phase. If the daily average device time is exceeded regularly we will recommend to upgrade your plan.

To change your plans:

* Navigate to your <a href="#settings">Account Settings</a>.
* Select the Plans tab from the menu.
* Choose the suitable plans for you.
* Click on the <b>Upgrade</b> button to upgrade your plan, click on the <b>Change</b> button to change to the selected plan or click on the <b>Downgrade</b> button to downgrade or cancel a plan.
