<h3 id="get_started">Get Started</h3>

Start testing your app on the TestObject cloud within less than a minute. 
Go to the <a href="https://app.testobject.com/#/signup">sign up</a> page and enter your basic information.
<img class="center shadow" src="/img/settings/Signup_form.png">
<br>
You will receive an email with a confirmation link which you have to follow.<br>
Now you are registered as a user with TestObject and are able to sign in with your previously set password.<br>
To be able to start to test you need to upload an app. There are several ways to do that:
<br>
<img class="center shadow" src="/img/settings/upload_app.png">
<br>

* Upload your native Android or iOS app directly from your system
* Test a Mobile Website by adding the Website URL and add a name and a version
* <a href="/docs/guides/continuous-integration/">Integrate a build plugin</a>, like Ant, Maven, Jenkins etc.
* Get your latest app versions directly from HockeyApp. Enter your <a href="https://rink.hockeyapp.net/manage/auth_tokens" target="_blank">HockeyApp token</a> and you are set.

<h3 id="plans">Testing Plans</h3>

After the signup you will start with a <b>free plan</b>. You will be able to upload your app and try out most of the features on the platform. It's not a trial, so you will be able to stay on the free plan unlimited in time. The free plan allows you to access a selection of free Nexus devices.
<img class="center shadow" src="/img/settings/free_devices.png"><br>

The <b>professional plans</b> allow you test on all of the hundreds of real devices and enjoy additional support services, like direct live support through our <a href="https://app.testobject.com/#/chat" target="_blank">Chat Tool</a> while testing. <br>
TestObject offers two distinct types of plans for Manual and Automated testing. Manual and Automated plans need to be purchased separately. This allows you to choose the best individual solution for your app testing.

To change your plan go to your <a href="#settings">Account Settings</a> and select the plans tab from the menu. Upgrade and downgrade your plans from there.


<h4>Manual Testing Plans</h4>

The plans differ in the number of users, parallel sessions and the available device time a day.

<h4>Automated Testing plans</h4>
