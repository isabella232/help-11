<h3 id="real-devices-how-it-works">Real Devices: How It Works</h3>
TestObject hosts hundreds of <strong>real smartphones and tablets in the cloud</strong> for manual and automated testing. You can remotely control all devices directly from your browser. 

The devices are located at TestObjects' data center in Germany, connected to servers. TestObject uses a virtual networking computer (VNC) to transmit mouse and keyboard events on a device. The VNC client on the device relays back the graphical screen, and you can control it remotely. It is almost like holding the device in your hands.

You can upload and test your mobile applications on the devices directly from your browser. As opposed to testing on emulators our real devices allow you to see what your customers see when they use your app on their hardware. 

A user accessing a device means that this phone is exclusively assigned to this user during the whole session and cannot be accessed by another user. To ensure frictionless testing TestObject provides several instances of the same device model. 

Every time a session starts the app gets installed freshly on the respective phone and the chosen settings are applied. At the end of every session the device gets set back to its default settings, the phone is getting cleaned completely. <strong>None of your data remains on the phone.</strong>

Every user will be able to use a <strong>fresh, standard phone that is not modified</strong>. This guarantees reliable, realistic test runs for every user and application.
