After you agree to the <a href="https://testobject.com/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Services</a>, you will receive an email with a confirmation link which you have to follow. That completes the registration process. Now, you can sign in with your email address (or your username) and your previously set password. You are now a [free user](#free_user) on TestObject.

Instead of using your email address for creating a new account on TestObject, you can sign up using other accounts, such as a Google account, a Github account or even a Linkedin account. After that, you will be able to login to TestObject with only one click.

<h3 id="free_user">What can I do as a free user?</h3>
As a free user, you are able to run your tests on our <a href="/docs/general-reference/devices/#free_pre">free real devices</a>.
The number of devices you can access and the testing time for free accounts are limited, apart from that you will be able to run your automated and manual tests on TestObject platform for free.<br>
This free account is not a trial, this means, you will be able to stay a free user and use our platform as long as you want. 

To enjoy more features and access all devices, you need to [upgrade your plan](/docs/general-reference/settings/#plans) to a premium one within your [account settings](/docs/general-reference/settings/#settings).
