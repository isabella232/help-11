<h3 id="upgrade-downgrade">Can I upgrade and downgrade plans at any time?</h3>
You can upgrade your plan at any time and it will start immediately. Charges also apply immediately. If you downgrade, your new plan starts from the next billing cycle. 

<h3 id="contract-duration">What is the duration of a monthly plan contract?</h3>
Our plans are monthly, and you can cancel at any time and downgrade to a free plan. This gives you high flexibility and you could e.g. just subscribe for one month.

<h3 id="payment-methods">Which payment methods do you accept?</h3> 
We accept credit card payments (Visa, Master­Card, Maestro) and - in certain cases - direct invoicing. When you subscribed to a monthly plan your credit card will be charged monthly. We’ll send you a monthly receipt. When you purchase a Prepaid package, we charge your Credit Card just once. 

<h3 id="minutes-used-up">What if my minutes are used up?</h3>
If your minutes are depleted, we restrict access to real devices. To obtain more minutes, just upgrade your plan or sublement your monthly plan purchasing a Prepaid package. In both cases we immediately credit more minutes. 

<h3 id="minutes-roll-over">Do unused minutes roll over?</h3>
The Prepaid minutes do not expire. The remaining minutes from a monthly plan do not roll-over to the next month. 

<h3 id="measure-minutes">How do you measure minutes?</h3>
When you use a real-device we track the minutes (rounded down) you’ve spent using the device. The device-minutes are subtracted immediately from your available volume of device minutes.
