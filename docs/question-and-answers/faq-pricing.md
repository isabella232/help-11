<h3 id="upgrade-downgrade">Can I upgrade and downgrade plans at any time?</h3>
You can upgrade your plan at any time and it will start immediately. Charges also apply immediately. If you downgrade, your new plan starts from the next billing cycle.

<h3 id="contract-duration">What is the duration of a monthly plan contract?</h3>
Our plans are monthly, and you can cancel at any time and downgrade to a free plan. This gives you great flexibility. For example, you could only subscribe for one month.

<h3 id="payment-methods">Which payment methods do you accept?</h3>
We accept credit card payments (Visa, Master­Card, Maestro). When you've subscribed to a monthly plan, your credit card will be charged monthly. We’ll send you a monthly receipt. When you purchase a prepaid package, we charge your credit card just once. In certain cases we do also accept direct invoicing. Please contact our sales team for further information.
