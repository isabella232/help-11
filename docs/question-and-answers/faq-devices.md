<h3 id="are-real-devices-real">How real are the real devices?</h3>
The devices at TestObject are real physical devices. They are standard commercially available devices and not modified or rooted. TestObject uses Virtual Networking Computer (VNC) to transmit mouse and keyboard events on the devices. The VNC client on the devices relaying back the graphical screen of the devices.

<h3 id="top-lists-by-country">What does the device top lists by country tell me and how reliable are they?</h3>
The top lists indicate the 10 most common devices by country. We gather information from an external provider who analyses mobile web traffic data from thousands and thousands of websites worldwide. The lists therefore should be quite reliable. A potential failure source is that by using the indicator "web traffic" for device destribution numbers, high-end devices and tablets might be overrepresented.

<h3 id="anomaly-top-lists">The devices in your top list do not coincide with top devices in my user base. Why?</h3>
When you compare the most popular devices of your users with our top lists you probably will see differences. A reason for this might be that our lists represent all mobile users whereas the users of your app(s) may differ in certain aspects from the overall population of mobile users. E.g. a food recipe app probably attracts a different user group than an outdoor navigation app and these user groups probably also prefer different device models. 

<h3 id="latest-devices">How long does it take until I can test on the latest devices at TestObject?</h3>
We try to implement new popular devices really fast. Usually we can provide new models three weeks after they got launched in Europe. 

<h3 id="device-missing">You don't have the device that I need. Can you get it for me?</h3>
Generally, YES. If the model you are looking for is not in our pool yet you can request it. Click on the link "device request" below "Search devices" in the device picker. When the requested model aligns with our overall purchasing strategy we'll get it for you. Additionally we offer a special service for our customers: "Professional" and "Expert" plan subscribers can bindingly ask for one respectively two devices per month.
