<h3 id="are-real-devices-real">How real are the real devices?</h3>
The devices at TestObject are real, physical devices. They are standard, commercially available devices and not modified or rooted. TestObject uses virtual networking computer (VNC) to transmit mouse and keyboard events on the devices. The VNC client on the devices relays back the graphical screen of the devices.

<h3 id="top-lists-by-country">What does the top device lists by country tell me, and how reliable are they?</h3>
The top lists indicate the ten most common devices by country. We gather information from an external provider who analyses mobile web traffic data from thousands of websites worldwide. The lists, therefore, should be quite reliable. A potential failure source is that, by using the indicator "web traffic" for device destribution numbers, high-end devices and tablets might be overrepresented. Older and low-cost devices often have a smaller screen and a poorer performance and therefore are less used for surfing the web than top devices. This is why the indicator "web-traffic" might underrepresent the overall distribution of these devices.

<h3 id="anomaly-top-lists">The devices in your top list do not coincide with top devices in my user base. Why?</h3>
When you compare the most popular devices of your users with our top lists you probably will see differences. A reason for this might be that our lists represent all mobile users whereas the users of your app(s) may differ in certain aspects from the overall population of mobile users. For example, a food recipe app probably attracts a different user group than an outdoor navigation app and these user groups probably also prefer different device models. 

<h3 id="latest-devices">How long does it take until I can test on the latest devices at TestObject?</h3>
We try to implement new popular devices really quickly. Usually, we can provide new models three weeks after they are launched in Europe. 

<h3 id="device-missing">You don't have the device that I need. Can you get it for me?</h3>
Generally, yes. If the model you are looking for is not in our pool yet you can request it. Click on the link "device request" below "Search devices" in the device selector. When the requested model aligns with our overall purchasing strategy, we'll get it for you.
