<h3 id="data-privacy">Is my app safe in the TestObject cloud?</h3>
The TestObject servers are located in Germany at certified data centers. The communication is .ssl secured. We try to ensure as much safety as a cloud service can provide. TestObject will never abuse your data and respect your data privacy at any time. You can find more information about this here: <a href="http://testobject.com/privacy" target="_blank">Data Privacy</a>. For very high security requirements we also provide a private cloud solution. Please find more information about this here: <a href="http://testobject.com/enterprise" target="_blank">Enterprise</a>.

<h3 id="data-protection">Can other users acces my data?</h3>
It is of great importance for us to make sure that no other user can see or access your data. This is why we clean-up the devices after each session. In detail we: 
<ul>
<li>Uninstall all user apps</li>
<li>Delete browser data</li>
<li>Clear SD card</li>
<li>Clear all accounts e.g. Google Play, Twitter ...</li>
<li>Finally we automatically check if the clean-up was successful and block the device if data has not been removed properly</li>
</ul>
