Running the Quality Report is pretty easy.

1. <b>Upload:</b> Upload your app or use the provided sample app and create a project.

2. <b>First test:</b> Navigate to the green "Quality Report" tab and hit the "Run Tests" button.

3. <b>Select devices:</b> Now, you can select the devices you want to run the tests on. Click the "Run" button.

4. <b>Results:</b> It will take 15 to 45 minutes until your results are ready. We will notify you by email when the tests are done. You will have an overview of all potential problems on the dashboard. Review the results and error messages and open a bug if somethings not right. You can also share your report with colleagues via a link or download the report, including all log files.

5. <b>Re-run:</b> Select other devices and run a new Quality Report or upload a new version of your app and see if it can handle the stress this time.
