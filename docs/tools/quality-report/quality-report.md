<h3 id="introduction">What is a Quality Report?</h3>
We know mobile app testing can be complex and time consuming. This is why we provide a simple and fast solution to check the functionality of your app, called the Quality Report. The Quality Report automatically runs multiple tests of your app and displays the results clearly on the dashboard. You can also share the results via a link or download the files. Tests included in the Quality Report are:

<ul>
<li><b>Install & Launch:</b> See if your app launches properly on different devices.</li>
<li><b>Stress Tests:</b> Check if your app can handle thousands of random inputs.</li>
<li><b>Screenshots:</b> Get an overview of how your app looks on different devices.</li>
</ul>

The Quality Report is best suited to test the basic functionality of your app on dozens of devices simultaneously with almost no effort. Your users will love your improved app!

<h3 id="install-launch">Install & Launch</h3>
We install your application on the TestObject devices to see if it launches properly. If we find an issue, we will flag the respective device.


<h3 id="stress-test">Stress Test</h3>
We simulate random user inputs until an exception is thrown. Our Stress Test is using the MonkeyExerciser from Google to execute random clicks within your app. Spot check the error flag and the exception messages for critical issues.


<h3 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h3>
TestObject takes screenshots of different activities within your app. Using the screenshot test, you can get a quick overview on how your app looks on different devices. After the screenshots are taken, you can review them and open bugs if somethings not right.
