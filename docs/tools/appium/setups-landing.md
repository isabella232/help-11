###Running Appium tests on TestObject
It is possible to run Appium tests on TestObject using different languages, testing frameworks and approaches. Here is a list of our go-to setups.

####[Basic setup](/docs/tools/appium/setups/basic-setups)
The Basic setup is the simplest, fastest way you can get started with running your Appium tests on TestObject. You don't need to worry about importing any libraries whatsoever: just choose the language you are most comfortable with and the device you want to test on, and let TestObject do the rest! [Learn more](/docs/tools/appium/setups/basic-setups)

####[Watcher setup](/docs/tools/appium/setups/watcher-setups)
The Watcher setup is an improvement over the Basic setup. It works basically the same way, the only exception being that you need to import the TestObject Appium library so the results of your tests can be neatly saved on TestObject! [Learn more](/docs/tools/appium/setups/watcher-setups)

####[Suite setup](/docs/tools/appium/setups/suite-setups)
If you want to easily run your tests in parallel on multiple devices while having your test reports neatly organized in suites, the Suite setup is what you are looking for! Just import our Appium API library, create a new suite on TestObject and link it with your test setup. [Learn more](/docs/tools/appium/setups/suite-setups)
