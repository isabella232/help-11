You need to use Suite setup when you want to run your Appium tests on multiple devices at the same time. To do that, you only need to create a new suite on TestObject, then to add some testing devices to the created suite, after that you run your tests on the new suite using the number "suiteId".

###Java
Java is the first language we choose to run tests on our platform. We currently support [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit4/).
