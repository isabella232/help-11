<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

Espresso is a test automation framework for Android applications developed by Google. It enables you to do automatic black-box UI-tests.  Therefor it uses the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Instrumentation.html">Android instrumentation</a> to inspect and interact with the activities you are testing. To locate the UI elements it draws back on <a href="https://github.com/hamcrest">Hamcrest matchers.</a>

<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>

Run an existing Espresso test on the TestObject device cloud within minutes, without any changes to your test. 

Steps to get started:

1. Create a <a href="https://app.testobject.com/signup" target="_blank">TestObject account</a>
2. Add a new app (web or native) to your account
3. Upload your app 
4. Select Espresso from the Dashboard and upload your test apk

5. Before you can run your test you have to choose your test devices from our <a href="/docs/general-reference/devices/">device cloud</a>. If you don't want to watch the progress of you test, we will send you a notification via email when your test is finished.

6. You are now ready to **run the test**!
7. You can watch the progress of the test while it gets executed. Otherwise just come back after the test run is completed and see all the results of your test neatly processed in your <a href="/docs/testing-tools/automation/reporting/">Execution Reports</a>.
