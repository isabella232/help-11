<h3 id="realdevices">Real-Decices</h3>
TestObject hosts 40+ real devices for manual and automated testing. You can find a list <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/testobject.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Apa3dP8CSozwdGhVazhpaTZ5Mm9FMndnRS1fM2JpUXc&usp=drive_web#gid=0" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h3 id="emulators">Emulators</h3>
In TestObject we rely also on Android emulators to run applications. While in most cases emulators provide the same runtime environment as real devices, sometimes there are differences. Our emulators are modified versions of the ones provided by Android SDK in which we fixed issues.  


<h3 id="versions">Android Versions</h3>
The relative number of devices running a given version of the Android platform is published on the official <a href="http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html#Platform" target="_blank" title="Android website">Android website</a>.
