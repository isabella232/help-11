### A simple usecase
Sometimes you want to check if something is available on screen (or not), and continue the test based on this information.  
For example, a popup that might appear, and needs to be cleard out if it does.  
  
A very simple scenario would be:  

<img class="center shadow" src="/img/guides/find-example/find-example.png">
