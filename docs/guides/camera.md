To use a camera in your test we suggest to use an app called “Fakecamera”. You can get the app (apk-file) in Goole Play store (http://www.shmoula.cz/fakecamera/). 

### Howto


**Step 1** Download the FakeCamera app so that you have the apk file. (Google Play)

**Step 2** Go to the apps tab in your app project and click on “+ New Dependency”.

**Step 3** Upload the FakeCamera.apk.

**Step 4** Now click on your custom UI Test in your testlist. (Open Recorder)

**Step 5** Click on Install Dependency in the left toolbar (Apps > Install Dependency)

**Step 6** Run your test one time to make sure that your dependency is installed. (Replay)

**Step 7** Use the camera feature in your app by clicking it. You can now select the FakeCamera instead of the normal camera app.
